            Welcome back! This is the second &#40and final&#41 session of the study
            you previously completed. We recommend you complete the study in the
            same location and time as the first study. So that we can match your
            data, you will also need the list of cards you selected during the
            first session.

            Please plan to complete the study in one sitting. If you navigate
            away from this page or if you stop to do something else, the task
            will continue to run and you will earn a low score and we will not
            be able to capture sufficient data to assess your performance. The
            study should only take about 5 minutes. We ask that you please set
            aside other tasks and distractions until the study is over.
