            >In this experiment, you will be presented with images of armed and
            unarmed male targets. Your job is to "shoot" all the armed targets
            by pressing the "i" key on your computer and to indicate "don't
            shoot" to all the unarmed targets by pressing the "e" key on the
            computer. Please respond as quickly and accurately as you can on
            each trial. Your response and reaction time will be recorded. At the
            end of each trial, you will recieve feedback and your score. You
            will begin by completing a short practice round.

            Please plan to complete the study in one sitting. If you navigate
            away from this page or if you stop to do something else, the task
            will continue to run and you will earn a low score and we will not
            be able to capture sufficient data to assess your performance. The
            study should only take about 5 minutes. We ask that you please set
            aside other tasks and distractions until the study is over.
